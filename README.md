# Go Release GitHub Action
![Build Docker](https://github.com/wangyoucao577/go-release-action/workflows/Build%20Docker/badge.svg) ![PR Build](https://github.com/wangyoucao577/go-release-action/workflows/PR%20Build/badge.svg) [![Test](https://github.com/wangyoucao577/go-release-action/actions/workflows/autotest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wangyoucao577/go-release-action/actions/workflows/autotest.yml)            
Automatically publish `Go` binaries to Github Release Assets through Github Action.

## Features
- Build `Go` binaries for release and publish to Github Release Assets.
- Customizable `Go` versions. `latest` by default.
- Support different `Go` project path in repository.
- Support multiple binaries in same repository.
- Customizable binary name.
- Support multiple `GOOS`/`GOARCH` build in parallel by [Github Action Matrix Strategy](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) gracefully.
- Publish `.zip` for `windows` and `.tar.gz` for Unix-like OS by default, optionally to disable the compression.
- No `musl` library dependency issue on `linux`.
- Support extra command that will be executed before `go build`. You may want to use it to solve dependency if you're NOT using [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
- Rich parameters support for `go build`(e.g. `-ldflags`, etc.).
- Support package extra files into artifacts (e.g., `LICENSE`, `README.md`, etc).
- Support customize build command, e.g., use [packr2](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr/tree/master/v2)(`packr2 build`) instead of `go build`. Another important usage is to use `make`(`Makefile`) for building on Unix-like systems.
- Support optional `.md5` along with artifacts.
- Support optional `.sha256` along with artifacts.
- Customizable release tag to support publish binaries per `push` or `workflow_dispatch`(manually trigger).
- Support overwrite assets if it's already exist.
- Support customizable asset names.
- Support private repositories.
- Support executable compression by [upx](https://github.com/upx/upx).
- Support retry if upload phase fails.    
- Support build multiple binaries and include them in one package(`.zip/.tar.gz`).       

## Usage

### Basic Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yaml

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

permissions:
    contents: write
    packages: write

jobs:
  release-linux-amd64:
    name: release linux/amd64
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: wangyoucao577/go-release-action@v1
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        goos: linux
        goarch: amd64
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | **Mandatory**/**Optional** | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| github_token | **Mandatory** | Your `GITHUB_TOKEN` for uploading releases to Github assets. |
| goos | **Mandatory** | `GOOS` is the running program's operating system target: one of `darwin`, `freebsd`, `linux`, and so on. |
| goarch | **Mandatory** | `GOARCH` is the running program's architecture target: one of `386`, `amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `s390x`, `loong64` and so on. |
| goamd64 | **Optional** | `GOAMD64` is the running programs amd64 microarchitecture level, which is available since `go1.18`. It should only be used when `GOARCH` is `amd64`: one of `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, `v4`. |
| goarm | **Optional** | `GOARM` is the running programs arm microarchitecture level, which is available since `go1.1`. It should only be used when `GOARCH` is `arm`: one of `5`, `6`, `7`. |
| gomips | **Optional** | `GOMIPS` is the running programs arm microarchitecture level, which is available since `go1.13`. It should only be used when `GOMIPS` is one of `mips`, `mipsle`, `mips64`, `mips64le`: one of `hardfloat`, `softfloat`. |
| goversion |  **Optional** | The `Go` compiler version. `latest`([check it here](https://go.dev/VERSION?m=text)) by default, optional `1.13`, `1.14`, `1.15`, `1.16`, `1.17`, `1.18`, `1.19`. You can also define a specific minor release, such as `1.19.5`. <br>Alternatively takes a download URL or a path to go.mod instead of version string. Make sure your URL references the `linux-amd64` package. You can find the URL on [Go - Downloads](https://go.dev/dl/).<br>e.g., `https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz`. |
| project_path | **Optional** | Where to run `go build`. <br>Use `.` by default. <br>If enable `multi_binaries: true`, you can use `project_path: ./cmd/...` or `project_path: ./cmd/app1 ./cmd/app2` to build multiple binaries and include them in one package.  |
| binary_name | **Optional** | Specify another binary name if do not want to use repository basename. <br>Use your repository's basename if not set. |
| pre_command | **Optional** | Extra command that will be executed before `go build`. You may want to use it to solve dependency if you're NOT using [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). |
| build_command | **Optional** | The actual command to build binary, typically `go build`. You may want to use other command wrapper, e.g., [packr2](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr/tree/master/v2), example `build_command: 'packr2 build'`. Remember to use `pre_command` to set up `packr2` command in this scenario.<br>It also supports the `make`(`Makefile`) building system, example `build_command: make`. In this case both `build_flags` and `ldflags` will be ignored since they should be written in your `Makefile` already. Also, please make sure the generated binary placed in the path where `make` runs, i.e., `project_path`. |
| executable_compression | **Optional** | Compression executable binary by some third-party tools. It takes compression command with optional args as input, e.g., `upx` or `upx -v`. <br>Only [upx](https://github.com/upx/upx) is supported at the moment.|
| build_flags | **Optional** | Additional arguments to pass the `go build` command. |
| ldflags | **Optional** | Values to provide to the `-ldflags` argument. |
| extra_files | **Optional** | Extra files that will be packaged into artifacts either. Multiple files separated by space. Note that extra folders can be allowed either since internal `cp -r` already in use. <br>E.g., `extra_files: LICENSE README.md` |
| md5sum | **Optional** | Publish `.md5` along with artifacts, `TRUE` by default. |
| sha256sum | **Optional** | Publish `.sha256` along with artifacts, `FALSE` by default. |
| release_tag | **Optional** | Target release tag to publish your binaries to. It's dedicated to publish binaries on every `push` into one specified release page since there's no target in this case. DON'T set it if you trigger the action by `release: [created]` event as most people do.|
| release_name           | **Optional**               | Alternative to `release_tag` for release target specification and binary push. The newest release by given `release_name` will be picked from all releases. Useful for e.g. untagged(draft) ones.|
| release_repo           | **Optional**               | Repository where the build should be pushed to. By default the value for this is the repo from where the action is running. Useful if you use a different repository for your releases (private repo for code, public repo for releases).|
| overwrite | **Optional** | Overwrite asset if it's already exist. `FALSE` by default. |
| asset_name | **Optional** | Customize asset name if do not want to use the default format `${BINARY_NAME}-${RELEASE_TAG}-${GOOS}-${GOARCH}`. <br>Make sure set it correctly, especially for matrix usage that you have to append `-${{ matrix.goos }}-${{ matrix.goarch }}`. A valid example could be  `asset_name: binary-name-${{ matrix.goos }}-${{ matrix.goarch }}`. |
| retry | **Optional** | How many times retrying if upload fails. `3` by default. |
| post_command | **Optional** | Extra command that will be executed for teardown work. e.g. you can use it to upload artifacts to AWS s3 or aliyun OSS |
| compress_assets | **Optional** | `auto` default will produce a `zip` file for Windows and `tar.gz` for others. `zip` will force the use of `zip`. `OFF` will disable packaging of assets. |
| upload | **Optional** | Upload release assets or not. It'll be useful if you'd like to use subsequent workflow to process the file, such as **signing it on macos**, and so on. |

### Output Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | -------- |
| release_asset_dir | Release file directory provided for use by other workflows. |
